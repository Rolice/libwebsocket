Now it is developed on desktop machine and will be back-ported.\r\n\r\nIt is still experimental and in process of implementation against [**RFC 6455**](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455).\r\n\r\nCurrent Status\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThe library now can make successful handshake with the clients and it can respond to messages. As it is still in experimental phase it is not directly usable. See the road map below.\r\n\r\nSimple Roadmap\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThe current road map is divided below in few points:\r\n\r\n* Callback Mechanism\r\n* Threading and Polling\r\n* SSL Support\r\n* Compression Support\r\n* C Compatible Linkage\r\n\r\nThe library is currently under development for linux platforms. There might be a Windows implementation as well with the advance and completion of the current road map points above.\r\n\r\nReference\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHere are some repositories I have inspected and borrowed some ideas, code or pure logical flow from:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/katzarsky/WebSocket\r\n* https://github.com/WebKit/webkit\r\n\r\nThe library was a part of a application project for Raspberry and later it was separated.\r\n","google":"UA-622833-30","note":"Don't delete this file!
